#contactlist

This is a simple and responsive app made using angularjs for front-end and nodejs as server.
In this project, I have created a photo galary on clicking of the image will show the relavant info of the individual.

As I am unable to fetch required multiple images, I have only used the first one I found suitable.

Functionalities:- Search contact by name.
On Image click, a popup will open with the relavant info of the contact.
